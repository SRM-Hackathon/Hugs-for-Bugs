  We will store some sample images in our database,  that will be linked with the cameras, and as soon as the camera detects those images, it will send an alert to the computer and the screen will go red so that the officials can identify the area of mishap. In addition to this, along with an error message, GPS location of that camera will be shared with the computer and all the cameras of that area will be on an alert, as soon as the culprit appears on another camera, itâ€™s GPS location will also be sent to the authorities to make it easier for them to catch the culprit
